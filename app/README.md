These code examples accompany the video course “[An Introduction to d3.js: From Scattered to Scatterplot](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/110000632.do)”.

These examples have also been used for similar workshops, which were presented on:

- 2014 January 8 as an [O’Reilly Webcast](http://oreillynet.com/pub/e/2952)
- 2014 February 11 at the [Strata Conference](http://strataconf.com/strata2014/public/schedule/detail/32866) in Santa Clara, California
- 2014 August 29 at [The Graphical Web](http://graphicalweb.org/2014/) in Winchester, England

Inline versions of these examples are also hosted on Atlas (no download required):
